    <h2>Speech Oct 11th:</h2> 

    The world as it may be, seems <b>scary</b> at times. I am sure that all of us know this feeling of helplessness that washes over us while we see things go foul. 
    <br>Here is where we make our difference, our community, our family can make the world a better place.
    <br>I wish to represent part of this family, as your future Justice of the Peace for District 7 I can promise you that there is no better option available for leadership. 
    <br>Change starts here, locally, and if you believe as I do that we can make a difference in this community then join me in electing those who represent the best that we have to offer, 
    those who wish to represent all who come before them and who come after, regardless of their race, ethnicity, religion, or creed. I stand here before you ready to represent all those who have made the choice- to join our community and become a part of our family. 
    <br>For those who find the roots of one's family as important as the beliefs of a candidate I still offer comfort, My family pioneered cisco road, opening a store there and helping foster our 
    fledgling community into what it is now. Even further back Brigadier General Henry Lewis Stimson, the Secretary of War for President Truman, spoke courageously and ferociously to defend and 
    uphold the American Dream, in essence the love of public service and duty to one's country quite literally flows through my veins. 
    As your Justice of the Peace I intend to fervently reform the status quo, and enact fair spending of your tax dollars, and install countywide ordinances which seek to better the whole of carroll county. 
    We ought as a constituency know where every penny and dime is spent and for what reason it was allocated, I have seen funds in excess of $50,000 dollars go misaccounted in the county budget, 
    <br>I have seen an airport which claims to bring vital economic life to our county fail to do so, yet still receive county provided improper funding exceeding $50,000. I see no reason why, 
    in the modern age of 2018 we do not have every road in the county publicly maintained and owned. 
    If you want a modern, functioning, and responsible county government vote for the candidate that has the courage and vision to bring about those changes, vote Colin Stimson on your 2018 Ballot, <i>Vote for 
    progress.</i>
