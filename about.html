            <h3> About ME</h3>
            <p> I am 23 years old at this time, born in the Southern United states near the turn of this century.<br>
            I have an intense interest in philosophical and legal studies, as well as information technology and programming! <br>
            It is my hope to combine these fields and help direct our civilization on a better path regarding the use and the creation <br>
            of new and existing technologies. I hope to do so through the legal system and, God willing, our political system. <br>
            I hope from this introduction I have earned your respect, and hopefully in the future your vote!

            <h3> My Education</h3>
            <p>
                Currently I am a student at the University of Missouri, where (as I mentioned in my introduction) I study Law and Information Technology. <br>
                Previously I have studied at North Arkansas College where I was awarded my Asociates Degree in General Studies. <br>
                Prior to this experience I attended a public high school in Arkansas where I graduated with honors and a completion for business. <br>
                Outside of traditional Education I have achieved the CompTIA A+ Certification proving my knowledge in the I.T. industry. I am now currently studying for the <br>
